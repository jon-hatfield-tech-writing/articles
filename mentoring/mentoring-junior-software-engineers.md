# Mentoring Junior Software Engineers
### by Jon Hatfield - Mar 6, 2023

Most senior and lead developers will help to train junior developers by virtue of their experience. However, companies
rarely offer official structure or guidance for the mentor. The mentor is usually fully responsible for defining and 
executing all aspects of the process. This in turn means that the process is far from standardized. This article is 
based on the resulting trial and error nature of my own experience, consisting of around 10 years of mentoring.

## Be Approachable

Being approachable is arguably the most important part of being a mentor. Ideally, the first step to should be to spend
at least a few minutes having a friendly chat and getting to know each other. There are many advantages to this, besides the
obvious courtesy and virtue of being kind. For example, it improves the working relationship from the start and even 
increase the potential to be friends. The mentee will in turn feel able to open up and give honest opinions. They will 
also be more confident, more likely to contribute and more motivated. A good relationship with your mentee is also 
beneficial to yourself as mentor because they will be more efficient and more likely to help you in return in future.

## Outline What You Propose To Do

To make sure that your expectations are aligned with those of your mentee it's necessary to propose what you intend 
to do. The contents and approach of a mentoring relationship is likely to be conceived of differently between
individuals so it helps to be explicit about your intentions. The nature of the mentoring will also vary depending
on the experience and capabilities of the mentee, the nature of the project and the expected level of their 
involvement. If there are clear tangible goals, such as specific features to be implemented, then these can be
defined and communicated. If the mentor is present mainly for their own benefit, for example they are gaining
work experience, then they may only be expected to generally help out and observe. If the mentee is very
inexperienced it can help to give them a demo project to work on until they are ready to contribute to a real
project. Also consider your own availability and time constraints and the potential for other colleagues to help
share the mentoring workload.

As a mentor you are also a leader, so expect the need to be proactive and let the mentor know that you are likely
to step in and take control sometimes. For example, if they are struggling on a task, it may be best to re-assign it
rather than push them too hard to do something that is beyond their capability. It is up to the mentor to observe
and assess whether to give support or to hand over a task to a more experienced engineer. Note that some mentees
may ask for help too easily, without trying sufficiently, whilst others may not admit that they are struggling, so
account for this individual variation when making a judgement.

## Ask Questions

Questions help to keep the mentoring on track. Perhaps the mentee needs help and they do not want to ask, or conversely
they may feel that they are being micromanaged. Sometimes a quick check that they are OK is sufficient since it will
trigger a conversation if one is needed. If there is a specific concern that you have, or there is a concern that you
suspect that they have, then it's best to address it. Have a private one-to-one meeting if the subject is sensitive and
remember to be tactful. If the subject is very sensitive, such as concerns about their achievements, it may be best
to seek the advice of a trusted colleague or line manager first, especially because some issues may not be your
responsibility to address. 

Keep in mind that different individuals will respond differently and also have different preferences and requirements
for how much you intervene. If in doubt then ask if they would prefer more or less questioning and tailor accordingly. 

## Be Agile

The 
[Agile](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)
methodology is now employed by most software teams and ideally your mentee will be part of this team. The mentoring
process should undergo frequent feedback and some of this will be achieved by sprints, retrospectives, pair 
programming and all the other standard Agile practices. Ad hoc meetings can also be used for feedback, along with
longer term scheduled meetings. If the mentee is fully integrated into the scrum team then the need for additional
meetings is minimal, otherwise it can be useful to have some short term and long term milestones.

If other team members are helping with the mentoring, for example the mentee is pair programming with another
developer or assisting a tester with QA, remember to get that team member's opinions and stay up to date with
developments. Also keep them up to date with your own learnings and observations about the mentee. As per the Agile
philosophy it's better to make small and frequent amendments instead of waiting for a longer term meeting. For example,
some mentees are very capable and can be given more responsibility; they may even ask for it too. In this case, 
everybody benefits by adapting quickly and giving them an increased or more complex workload.

## Show Appreciation

Thanking a mentee and articulating how they have helped, whether verbally or sent electronically, will make them 
feel appreciated and keep your working relationship healthy. It also contributes to a positive working
environment and sets a good example to colleagues. It takes very little time or effort yet has a big impact.
