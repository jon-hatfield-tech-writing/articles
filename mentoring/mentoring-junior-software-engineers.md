# Mentoring Junior Software Engineers
### by Jon Hatfield - Mar 1, 2023

<p>
Most senior and lead developers will help to train junior developers by virtue of their experience. However, companies
rarely offer official structure or guidance for the mentor. The mentor is usually fully responsible for defining and 
executing all aspects of the process. This in turn means that the process is far from standardized. This article is 
based on the resulting trial and error nature of my own experience, consisting of around 5 years of mentoring.
